# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-with-Python 📈📉📊⏰

🤘 Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Time-Series Analysis and Forecasting using Python 👨🏻‍💻. This repository is designed to equip you with the knowledge, tools, and techniques to tackle the challenges of analyzing and forecasting time-series data. Whether you're a beginner curious about the basics of time-series analysis or an advanced practitioner aiming to delve into the depths of forecasting models, this guide has something for you🫱🏻‍🫲🏼.

🚀 The contents are structured to provide a logical progression, starting with an introduction to the concepts and practices of time-series analysis, followed by data visualization techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and more in-depth data analysis. We then transition 💥 into various forecasting methodologies, including classical statistical models, cutting-edge deep learning approaches, and the application of Facebook's Prophet tool for both univariate and multivariate forecasting 🌟 scenarios.

Cheers!! 🍻
