# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-with-Python
<p>Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.</p>
<p>Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economics, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post. We will demonstrate different approaches for forecasting retail sales time series. Let’s get started!</p>
